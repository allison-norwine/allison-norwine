    <h2> 1.1: Name at least two other services that you personally use which are implemented using a Client/Server Mode</h2>
    Emails, and social media
    <h2> 2.1: It appears that both Jack Williams and John Williams can have a directory of the same name. Do you think the ability to have two different users create a directory of the same name is important? Why?</h2>
    Yes, it is important because it can distinguish sub-directories of the same name by their directory.
    <h2> 3.1: Why do you think the home directory has a special symbol to represent it?</h2>
    So you know where you are in your files.
    <h2> 4.1: Did the prompt change? If so, how? Why is this useful?</h2>
    Yes, It added /Merlin, It shows the path is shown and where you are.
    <h2>5.1: What happens each time you press the ↑?</h2>
    It copies the thing(s) above it.
    <h2> 5.2: What happens each time you press the ↓?</h2>
    It copies the things below it (once you go up you can go down)
    <h2> 6.1: Was "Hello, World!" printed to the screen as before? If not, why not? What do you think happened to the text?</h2>
    Yes, I think it was redirected to another file.
    <h2> 7.1: How does the ls command differ from the tree command?</h2>
    Ls shows the contents of the directory you are in and the tree command gives you the outline of the whole terminal/shows you the paths.
    <h2> 7.2: How do you choose to use one over the other?</h2>
    It depends on what you want to see and get done, if you want to know how to get to a place/file- use the tree command, but if you just want to se\e the contents of a directory- use the ls command.
    <h2> 8.1: What do you think the argument to sleep specifies?</h2>
    How long the tabby is asleep/inactive
    <h2> 8.2: Are you able to prove your hypothesis? How?</h2>
    Yes, by counting how long it takes for the tabby to start up/work again.
    <h2> 9.1: How is the behavior different from what you expected?</h2>
    You are able to let one thing sleep but able to do another thing.
    <h2> 9.2: What do you think it means to run a job in the background?</h2>
    Being able to do one thing but then in the background, another thing is happening.
    <h2> 9.3: What do you think the number displayed in brackets specifies?</h2>
    How many things are going on in the background.
    <h2>10.1: What do you observe as you execute the jobs command?</h2>
    It shows 2 things that say they are both stopped.
    <h2> 10.2: How do you explain your observations?</h2>
<hr>    
    They are 2 jobs that have stopped running.
    <p> What challenges did I encounter?<br />
      Messing up commands and making random things happen.<br />
      How could this experience be improved?<br />
      Double checking what I am supposed to do before entering command.<br />
      Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?<br />
      I learned that everything has a command which then has another command to complete the process wanted, this has caused me to think more about h\ow things are made and what/how much work goes into them. <p>
