<h1>Why is My Digital Portfolio Important to Me? </h1>
<h3>My digital portfolio is important to me because it shows the work and knowledge that I have learned so far in Computer Science 1. This portfolio shows growth and improvement throughout my course of learning, but also a place of achievement and accomplishments. In the future I can refer back to this and use it for important things like resumes for jobs or colleges.</h3>
