    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1:What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Carry column? </h2>
    I recognize the outputs in the Carry column is the same as an AND truth table.
    <h2>1.2:What truth table do you recognize that produces the output of the Sum column?</h2>
    I recognize the outputs in the Sum column is the same as a XOR tuth table.
    <h2>2.1:What do you notice about the relationship between the first-half (top four rows) of the full-adder as compared to all of the rows of the half-adder?</h2>
    
    <h2>2.2:Why is this true?</h2>
    <h2>3.1:Why does the least significant bit position use a half-adder rather than a full-adder?</h2>
    <h2>3.2:Assume that proper inputs are applied for all bits in numbers A and B. Will the correct output from S be available instantaneously? If not, why not?</h2>
    <h2>3.3:Assume that we have a standard (non-scientific calculator) capable of adding two 16-bit words. Two numbers, A and B, are added together. After the addition, it is noted that "C subscript 15" is high. What can we infer? What is this state commonly called?</h2>
