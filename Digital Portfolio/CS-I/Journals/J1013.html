    <h1>Questions</h1>
    <h2>1.1: Why is one of the symbols used for exclusive disjunction?</h2>
Because exculisvie disjunction is showing that they are not equivelent.
    <h2>2.1: Why is the formula for determining the number of rows in a truth table related only to the number of inputs, and why is the formula 2^n?</h2>
   Each input has 2 potential values (true or false). Since there are only two options you can find every combination by mutiplying 2*2*2... a n number of time where n is the number of inputs which gives us the result of 2^n.

      <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
      I found it a bit tedious and overwhelming trying to figure out what was happening and what I was intended to learn/do.
      <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
      By just taking it one step at a time and asking for help if needed.
	<h2>Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
	This process has made me think more logically.
