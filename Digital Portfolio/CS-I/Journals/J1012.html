      <h1>Questions</h1>
<h2>1.1: Describe the general process for executing addition, regardless of base.</h2>
Align the digits vertically, add the right-most column, if sum is greater than quanity that can be represented by a single digit-  carry over, then if more to left repeat.  
<h2>2.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with octal numbers?</h2>
The quantity range is 0-7, if exceeds minus number by 8 then carry a 1; 8 is like your 10.
<h2>3.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with hexadecimal numbers?</h2>
The quantity range is 0-9 and A-F/10-15, if exceeds minus number by 16 then carry a 1; 16 is like your 10. But also 10-15 is represented by letters.
<h2>4.1: What special factors need to be considered when executing addition with binary numbers?</h2>
The quantity range is 0-1, if exceeds minus number by 2 then carry; 2 is like your 10.

    <h2>What challenges did I encounter?</h2>
    Forgeting in hexadecimals that 10-15 is represented by letters.
    <h2>How could this experience be improved?</h2>
    By writing the following: A= 10 B= 11 C= 12 D= 13 E= 14 F= 15, I will be able to remember to write letters instead.
    <h2> Free Reflection: How has what I've learned affected my thinking?</h2>
    This has really made my brain think through simple addition instead of just flowing through it.
